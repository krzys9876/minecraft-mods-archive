# Minecraft plugins - archive #

This repository contains an archive of my old Minecraft plugins that I wrote years ago.
This was a purely hobbyist project, without too much attention to clean code or testing - just make it work using trial and error approach.

I particularly like 

* tpLogo - a LOGO interpreter for Minecraft

* tpText - write text made with blocks using different fonts

Other plugins are:

* tpKits - simple commands to add equipment and some other (e.g. fly in survival mode)

* tpMobs - spawn more powerfull mobs to have even more fun when fighting them

* tpArena - build an arena, save it, play with it and revert all changes after the game is over
